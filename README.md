Hi Hola MyLaVu

Newbie here, I like eating foods, making friends, listening to music and dancing. 
Unfortunately, I cann't dance but just make some weird body movements instead. 
I just realized there are many things I want to know and self-cultivate as well as learn from others. 
This is why I joined Github.
